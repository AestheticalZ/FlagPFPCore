<img src="logo.png" alt="logo" width="128" height="128"/>

My old CLI program, but improved and converted into a .NET library for general usage.

**Available in NuGet!** https://www.nuget.org/packages/FlagPFP.Core/

The package will be added to the Github Package Registry soon.

# Usage
The source code contains XML documentation that can aid you in development. If you still need a reference while I implement proper documentation to this repository, check out [this repository.](https://github.com/AestheticalZ/flagpfp-gui)

The repository linked above also has an example folder with pretty much all pride flags I could find. Feel free to use them, of course!
